> Declare all light is white
By doing this we only have one light intensity value if not, we need 3 intensity, RGB channels.
> Ignore atmosphere
Lights dont become less bright no matter how far away.

Point Lights
> Emits light from a position
> Emitted equally in every direction (Omnidirectional Lights)
> Fully characterized by its position and intensity
> Approximately a light bulb
e.g. L> is direction from a point in scene P to light, Q.
Light Vector = Q - P
Since Q is fixed, and P is anypoint in the scene, 
L> is different for all points in scene.

Directional Lights
> Has intensity but no position, it has a direction
> Basically a point light that is extremely far away from scene
> Basically a Sun
e.g. L> is different for every point in scene just like Point Light
(Center of Light Source) - (Center of Earth) = L>

Ambient Lights
> When light hits an object, part of it is absorbed and the rest is scattered back into the scene
> Light can also come from objects not just light sources
> Light loses brightness after bouncing once 
> All objects must be treated as light source
> Characterized by intensity only
> Unconditonally contributes light to every point in the scene

Scene Science
> A scene will have 1 ambient light since it only has intensity value and any number of them can be
combined into one light
> A scene will also have a number of point and directional lights
> To calculate illumination at a point, we calculate amount of light contributed by each light source
and add them together to get a single number representing total amount of light it receives
> The amount of light it receives will be multipled by the color of the surface at that point to get
its appropriate lit color
> Objects are classified into 2 broad classes, MATTE and SHINY
> Most objects are classified as MATTE

Matte Objects (Diffuse Reflection)
> When a ray of light hits a matte object, since the surface of this kind of objects is irregular,
it reflects back light into the scene equally in every direction
> This is known as Diffuse Reflection
e.g. The light reflected from a wall is the same no matter where you're looking at it (Color does not change)
> However the amount of light reflected does depend on the angle between the ray of light and the surface
> This is because the energy carried by the ray has to spread over a smaller or bigger area depending on the
angle, resulting in energy reflected per unit area of the object being higher or lower
> We characterize the orientation of a surface by its normal vector, N>
> This means N> is a vector perpendicular to the surface at some point
> N> is also a unit vector which means it has a length of 1

Modeling Diffuse Reflection
> If a ray of light with direction L> and intensity I hits a surface with normal N>,
What fraction of I is reflected back to the scene as a function of N>,L> and I
> Taking the intensity of the light as the width of the ray, its energy spreads over a surface of size A
> If N> and L> have the same direction, the ray is perpendicular to the surface
> This means that the reflected energy is similar to the incident energy per unit area, I = A and I/A = 1
> As the angle between N> and L> approaches 90 degrees, A approaches infinity meaning energy per unit area 
approaches 0 (Lim A->inf I/A = 0)
> Since ray of light has no width, the assumption that all reflection happens at an infinitely small flat plane
> Width of light ray = I, Area light spreads out over = A, N = Surface Normal, L = Direction of Light
> I/A = dot(N,L)/N*L where N and L cannot be negative in the denominator
> If dot(N,L) / N*L = negative, it means light is reaching the back of the surface and does not contribute to illumination
thus we treat it as 0

Diffuse Reflection Full Equation
> Ip = Intensity of light at a point, Ia = Ambient light intensity, N = Normal, n = Number of point or directional lights
, In = Intensity of the n lights
> Ip = Ia + Sum of n(In) * dot(N,L) / N*L where L, the light vector is either directional light and known or point light
and computed

Identifying Sphere Normals
> Direction of normal vector of any point on the sphere can be calculated by the center of the sphere minus the point 
> Direction of Normal Vector = P - C
> Normal = P - C / P - C where denominator cannot be negative, modulied
