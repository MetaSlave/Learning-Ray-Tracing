Dot Product:
Ax . Bx + Ay . By

Point on Sphere = <P-C,P-C> = radius^2
Point on Ray    = P = O + tD

Where P is a point,
Where C is the center of the sphere,
Where O is the point of camera,
Where V is the point of viewport,
Thus D is the direction of the ray (Vector)
t is a variable

k1 = <D,D>
k2 = 2<OC,D>
k3 = <OC,OC> - r^2

Equation:
k1(t^2) + k2(t) + k3

Will Yield:
(t1,t2) or (t,t) or no solutions

t = 0, On Camera
t = 1, On Viewport
t < 0, Behind Camera
0 <= t <= 1 Between Camera and Viewport
t > 1 Scene
